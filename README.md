- 👋 Hi, I’m @ChenControl
- 👀 I’m interested in optimization control by means of Deep learning, for the purpose of vibration control.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning 1, GYM, ChainerRL and Warp for survey and comparsion. Also, I am reading https://julien-vitay.net/deeprl/Introduction.html#sec:introduction for theoritical studying. It is great.
                            2, High performance computation with CPU/GPU to solve nonlinear dynamic problems.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Robot control and HPC on FEM
